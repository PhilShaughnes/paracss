# CSS only parallax scrolling

This is meant to be a simple example, reference, and learning experiment
for CSS parallax scrolling.

## Development/Play

When I'm working/playing around with something like this, I often use [devd](https://github.com/cortesi/devd) so I don't have to refresh the browser.

You can run `devd -io .` from the project directory. This will open a
browser window with the project, and will auto-refresh when you save
changes to a file in the project.
